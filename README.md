## Activity Classification
Using L1 penalized logistic regression to classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network.The classification tasks consist in predicting the activity performed by the user from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network.

**Data:**
This dataset contains temporal data from a Wireless Sensor Network worn by an actor performing the activities: bending, cycling, lying down, sitting, standing, walking.
